I have decided to start compiling a brief list of dates and events in the cryptocurrency space that may have affected prices, or stirred twitter activity.

The cryptocurrency news websites I've found are pretty detailed and I am starting to think this is something that would have been worth starting at the beginning of the project, but I think only a brief selection of major events that might explain some of the peaks in activity in the twitter data collected would be good.

At the end of the project I hope to put all these dates on a timeline next to relevant graphs and maybe line them out in a large blog post, or as an appendix to the report.

For now I'll put down some of the big events of the past couple of months below and In future I might do some blog posts looking at the weeks price and twitter activity and try to compile some news which might explain some of the spikes.

This list is by no means exhaustive and may be added to in time, not many Elon Musk tweets feature here, but his account seems particularly influential and in many senses may deserve a list of their own. I came across an interesting paper on the topic while researching [link](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3778844).

Anywhoo, hopefully I'll find some time to look through the dates and see if there's any corresponding spikes in activity, or tweets that seem to mention them. I also plan to do the reverse and see if some of the spikes seen in the data are the result of news/events (or not).
