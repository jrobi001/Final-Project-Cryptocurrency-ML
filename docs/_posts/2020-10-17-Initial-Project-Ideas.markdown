# Initial Project Ideas

This blog will follow the development of a final year computer science project. Below are some of the initial ideas for projects I came up with over the summer.

Over the next few weeks one or two of the ideas will be fleshed out into proposals investigating their feasibility, as well as, how interesting or challenging the implementation process will be for them.

Hopefully these ideas will change and grow over the coming weeks!

1 - **A pronunciation focused language application**. Often language methods focus too mostly on vocabulary and grammar mostly ignoring pronunciation.

Studying Japanese readers often encounter compound kanji words where they may be able to guess or remember the meaning of a word, but cannot guess or remember the pronunciation.

Similar problems are encountered when studying many languages, including romance languages, for example English can be difficult for the learner when spelling rules and pronunciation rules do not align.

The application would present sentences and allow the user to record their pronunciation (if wanted) then compare it either to text to speech generated version or ideally version recorded by a native speaker. The application would allow the user to identify words that gave issue and this data would be used to present users with a mix of easier and harder sentences based on their level. Not sure if possible, to use machines to analyse the tonal inflections of voice recordings, alternately could have native speakers able to pass comment or pronunciation suggestions to users if they want to share their attempts. (contexts: language learning, user input, techniques: data analysis, maybe machine learning)

2 - **A walk suggesting application** that both helps send users on walks they might not have gone on before in their local area and sends them to or via points of interest, such as places with local history. The app would keep track of previous walks so as not to send them in the same direction each time.

The app could also be a place to share favourite walks, perhaps with historical information or facts on locations along the route that could be sent to the user as they near them (if wanted), or just scenic walks. Could also be used as a sort of tour guide app for cities with user contributed guides of different types. (contexts: real-world interaction, user input, techniques: route finding algorithms)

3 - **A location-based message board or forum** where messages can only be posted or viewed if within the geographic area of that board. Areas would be user defined.

Could be used just for fun; by businesses to post information to patrons; to provide a live-chat for people at physical events / gatherings or as a way to ask questions from crowds at debates. It Could also be used to place clues for alternate reality games (ARG) or treasure hunts.

4 - **A habit and routine forming aiding application.** It takes about 60 days to form a habit / establish a routine and habits stick better if done at the same time each day.

Principally the application would allow you to set a general or specific days activity with certain activities set to remind you to do them. When starting the reminders for habits deemed important may be intrusive, such as an alarm with a 5 min 'snooze' until you start, but the intrusiveness should diminish over time as the habit becomes more established.

The application might allow you to track the time spent on activities and emphasise the importance of doing the activity if only for a minute or two when starting out. The app would also preferably also have an always on notification showing what planned task you should be doing each time you open your phone. (contexts: productivity, app development, techniques: data analysis)

5- **Non-standard character input tool**. It can be frustrating typing notes for subjects such as biology and chemistry due to the lack of an easy and quick way to input non-standard characters.

For example: In biology gene names often contain non-standard characters such as δ, α, β. It is also hard to type other notes without symbols like ⇋, ≤, ≥ or shorthand symbols such as ∴, ↳ or →. Furthering this gene variants are often are more clearly written using super and sub-script (such as CLOCKΔ19).

Notepad can be used to store these symbols to be copied into notes fairly quickly, but it cannot store text with super or sub-script. A program that allows a user to store a set of symbols or terms that will be used frequently when typing (perhaps with keyboard shortcuts) could be useful for science students wanting to move away from using hand-written notes.
