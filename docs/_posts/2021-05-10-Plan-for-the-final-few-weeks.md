So time is marching on, and the project is drawing to a close. The 90 day collection period ended a few days back, so models are running on the final data set.

I'm still collecting and updating the dataset, but I won't be training models on any data past the 90 day cutoff.

( I am considering evaluating my final models for each cryptocurrency on the days following it after training on the full 90 day period e.g. testing final models on days 90 to 100)

Still a lot left to do~~

Work to do cleaning up the repository and setting it up for someone else to clone and set up for collection easily.

Lots of models which can be run, though I'm getting an idea of which sets of parameters are working best. I don't think I can feasibly run every combination, but I'm quite happy with the method I'm using to eliminate parameters and features which don't seem promising (based on a set of overfitting and under-fitting model shapes and sizes with and without dropout). I'm not sure if that's a valid way to go about eliminating parameters, but I think it gives a good indication.

Then there's the report, I may need to drop most development work and focus on that soon. I've never been good at writing long essays or projects, but I'm starting to work on explaining the methods I'm using and what I've made.

I may make another blog post, which will be a final summary of all the major cryptocurrency news over the project period. It has been quite an interesting time for cryptocurrencies!
