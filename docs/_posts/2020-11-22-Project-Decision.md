# Project Decision

On reflection I have decided to commit to the Cryptocurrency project Idea, it neatly aligns with my modules this year and should allow for some some good exploration of machine learning techniques, hopefully making for a good report.

The other project ideas were good, but may have relied a little too heavily on external APIs. Also as the development period is fairly short, an application may not end up incredibly polished or properly validated with target users.

So my final project will be something along the lines of:

**Evaluating machine learning models to predict cryptocurrency price changes with and without twitter data**

I am very keen to have twitter data (or some other data source) used in the models alongside previous price data. I may look into the feasibility of also accessing Reddit or Facebook page data relating to cryptocurrencies as this may be fun to compare, but for now the focus will be twitter.

The next steps will be:

- Researching and implementing a twitter scrape
- Finding sources of historical cryptocurrency price data
- Researching machine learning models that may work well with the data
- Working out how to pre-process the twitter and price data for the models
- Planning how to run sentiment analysis on tweets
- Lots of other things
- ???
- profit

This week I will focus on working out how to scrape twitter. Hopefully next weekend I'll have something to report back here.
