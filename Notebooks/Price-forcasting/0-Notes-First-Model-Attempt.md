# 0-First-Model-Notes

Things went generally well, some things to do:

- Retain the number of samples in train, val and test and their final indexes in separate variables.
- Create functions (stored in helper files) for many of the data processing steps, as well as for plots that will be used frequently.
- Create methods of filtering out duplicate data of the type seen here (records not identical, but increased precision).
