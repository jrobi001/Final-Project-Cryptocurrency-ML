# Predicting Cryptocurrency Prices Using Machine Learning and Twitter Data

This is a repository for a final year CS project.

The plan is to use machine learning models on cryptocurrency data with and without twitter data to see to what degree cryptocurrency price changes can be predicted.

This project is still in it's early stages, but hopefully It will fill up soon.
